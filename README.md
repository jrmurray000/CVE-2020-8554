# Mitigate CVE-2020-8554 with Policy Controller


This repository contains configuration files for using Policy Controller or Gatekeeper to block Kubernetes Services from public IP access.

The [security advisory for this issue](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/GPpZzVtGwiI) states:
>A security issue was discovered with Kubernetes affecting multitenant clusters. If a potential attacker can already create or edit services and pods, then they may be able to intercept traffic from other pods (or nodes) in the cluster.
>
>This issue has been rated medium severity (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L), and assigned CVE-2020-8554.
>
>An attacker that is able to create a ClusterIP service and set the spec.externalIPs field can intercept traffic to that IP. An attacker that is able to patch the status (which is considered a privileged operation and should not typically be granted to users) of a LoadBalancer service can set the status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip to similar effect.
